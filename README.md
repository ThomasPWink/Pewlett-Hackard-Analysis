# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Due to the rapid rate of retirement among baby boomers, Pewlett Hackard is looking towards the future and has begun analysis of the employment population that will soon be retiring.  We will be looking into how many employees will be retiring and what positions they hold.  In doing so we will be able to create different mentorship programs so the company will be able to fill those positions and get the new employees train. 

## Results
* The total number of retirees will be 72,458 out of a total workforce of 240,124 which is just over 30%. 
* 35% of the retirees are senior engineers and 34% are Senior Staff 
### Retiries by Job Title

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" begins below are totals by each department of retirees. That is a total of 72,458 replacements need just to start. Another 166,117 employees will be reaching the age of retirement leaving just the 1,549 employees that are eligible for mentorship.  They would be required to train an entire new workforce.

The mentorship eligibility would need to be increased.  Changing the age range from 01-01-1965 to 12-31-1965 to 01-01-1964 to 12-31-1965 will add an additional 18,356 employees eligible to mentor the new generation of employees.  If each of these 19,905 employees are able to mentor 4 new employees then the "silver tsunami" will be replaced.
